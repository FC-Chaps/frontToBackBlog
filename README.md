Full-stack Blog App
===================

Blogging app for creating, editing and posting blog entries (including User authentication).

This app was designed and built in 5 days! 

`git clone`
`npm install`
`node index.js`

Missing the following pieces:
* open auth connection to Facebook
* error pages for when someone tries to do something before signing in
* redirects for when someone attempts something unauthorised
* keys for the mongouri database - CRITICAL
